# Changelog

## 2.2.0 - 2026-10-11

### What's new

**Gameplay feels the same on every device**
- The game now runs at a fixed 60 steps per second and draws in between, so it plays at the same speed on 60Hz, 120Hz and 144Hz+ screens and stays smooth on all of them.
- Pausing really pauses: spell cooldowns and the level timer no longer keep running behind the pause menu.
- Pressing Escape to close the pause menu resumes the game instead of leaving it frozen.

**Fairer items on phones**
- Missed items are counted when they leave the visible screen. On high-density screens they used to fall a whole extra screen first, which delayed the penalty and slowed down new drops.
- Items and power-ups now drop across the full width of the screen instead of mostly on the left.
- Items near the left edge fall in from above like the rest instead of popping in at the top.
- Fast-falling items at high levels can no longer slip past the player between frames.

**Everything is the size it was meant to be**
- Icons are drawn at their intended size on phones. Small source images used to be shrunk to about half size while their hitboxes stayed full size.
- Weapons and spell effects with transparent padding are trimmed so the visible artwork fills its space, and nothing is stretched out of proportion.

**Faster and lighter**
- Sprites and their glows are rendered once at the size they're shown and reused every frame.
- Builds now resize oversized images automatically: about 10MB less to download.
- The shadowbolt impact sound plays again (it pointed at a file that didn't exist).

**High scores**
- Player names on the high score table can no longer inject HTML into the page.
- Score submissions are validated, rate limited and written safely when several arrive at once.

### For developers
- `npm test` runs the timing tests.
- `npm run assets:report` shows which images are larger than the game needs; `npm run build` optimizes them in `dist/`. See `tools/optimize-assets.js`.
- Falling items, power-ups and projectiles share one movement implementation in `classes/FallingObject.js`.
- Cross-origin access to the high score API is off by default; allow sites with `EFTO_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (see `.env.example`).
